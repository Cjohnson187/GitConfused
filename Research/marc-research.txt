As a developer, I need to implement some of the integer operations because these are the easiest to start with.
Execute opcode integer operations.
Should this be in python or java (Since it is opcode does it matter?)

Implement integer operations:
opcodes to be implemented https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=8558
Postfix?

As a developer, I will need to create the stack for operands because the JVM is a stack-oriented machine:

Push operands onto a stack.

As a developer, I will need to create simple Java files to test my integer operation implementation because I need to make sure I'm interpreting the opcodes correctly:

Was this meant to by a python file test? (It is a java file)

def p1(args):
    whatever

def p2(more args):
    whatever

myDict = {
    "P1": p1,
    "P2": p2,
    ...
    "Pn": pn
}
